# BensVM
A VM that works a little like Java
This is still an unfinished project but once complete will become a runtime for a high level language there not many examples but you should be able to make small examples it you look at the op codes in the code. it sort of like java asm code so you should have an idea of how to make something hope you lie the first update.
